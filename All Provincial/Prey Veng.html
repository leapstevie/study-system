      <p>Prey Veng (Khmer: ព្រៃវែង [prɨj.ʋɛːŋ]; lit. 'High Forest') is a province (khaet) of Cambodia. The capital
        is Prey Veng. With a population of 1.1 million people, it is the third most populous province.

        This densely populated agricultural region is located on the east bank of the Mekong. The name literally
        means "long forest" in khmer, but the last great forests have gradually disappeared there over 30-year
        to provide for agricultural land. In early Christian era, the province was a major center of the kingdom
        of Funan, between economic and political capitals of the country what were Oc Eo (now in the Vietnamese
        province of An Giang) and Angkor Borei (in the Cambodian province of Takéo province).

        However, with the advent of Chen-la, the hub of the kingdom moved farther west, to Koh Ker and Angkor
        and the region lost its importance.

        In the 15th century, the Khmer emperors, under threat from the Siamese (former name of people of current
        Thailand) decided to resettle back to the east, to Oudong, Lovek then Phnom Penh. Prey Veng did not
        favor them as it was too close to another danger, namely the Annam. Nevertheless, they formed an army at
        Ba Phnom in 1473 to defend against an invasion of Siam.

        Under the French protectorate, the colonial authorities saw potential of the region in terms of
        agriculture and fishing and its proximity to the French colony of Cochin China. Mass deforestation took
        place, to create land for agriculture.</p>
