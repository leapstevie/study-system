      <p>Preah Sihanouk (Khmer: ព្រះសីហនុ, UNGEGN: Preăh Seihânŭ, ALA-LC: Braḥ Sīhanu [preah səjhanuʔ], lit. 'Holy
        Sihanouk'), also Sihanoukville, is a province (khaet) in southwest Cambodia on the Gulf of Thailand. The
        provincial capital, also called Sihanoukville, is a deep water port city and a steadily growing and
        diversifying urban center on an elevated peninsula.[5]

        First established as Kampong Som (Khmer: កំពង់សោម, lit. 'The Som Rattan Port'), the province was later
        renamed in honor of former King Norodom Sihanouk, who orchestrated the establishment of Sihanoukville
        city and the Sihanoukville municipality as this took place alongside the construction of the
        Sihanoukville Port, which commenced in June 1955. The only deep water port of Cambodia, it includes an
        oil terminal and a transport logistics facility.[6][7]

        Preah Sihanouk is divided into four districts, each with a distinct economic character, defined largely
        by location and access to resources.[8] In addition to the port and the growing tourism industry, the
        activities of countless NGOs and international investment have contributed to the rapid economic growth
        of the province over the course of the last decade.[9] Primary economic sectors are transport and
        logistics, process manufacturing, agriculture and fisheries, textiles, and real estate.

        The islands and beaches of Preah Sihanouk Province are an international tourist destination as visitor
        numbers have risen steadily since the late-20th century.[10][11]

        Sihanoukville municipality was elevated to provincial status on 22 December 2008 after King Norodom
        Sihamoni signed a decree converting the municipalities of Kep, Pailin, and Sihanoukville into provinces,
        as well as incorporating Kompong Seila District.[12][13] As one of Cambodia's agriculturally and
        industrially most diverse provinces, its economic future has a solid basis, although the essential
        sectors of agriculture and tourism require strict and permanent administrative protection of local
        natural resources.[14][15][16]</p>
