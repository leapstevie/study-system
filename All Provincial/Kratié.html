      <p>Kratié (Khmer: ក្រចេះ, Krâchéh [krɑˈceh]), alternatively spelled Kracheh, is a province of Cambodia
        located in the northeast. It borders Stung Treng to the north, Mondulkiri to the east, Kampong Thom and
        Kampong Cham to the west, and Tboung Khmum, and the country of Vietnam to the south.

        The province’s capital is the town of Kratié located within the Kratié Municipality.
        
        "Kratié" is the French spelling derived from the Khmer ក្រចេះ Krâchéh ([krɑːceh]).

        The area now known as Kratié was part of the early first millennium Kingdom of Funan until Funan itself
        was superseded and absorbed in the 6th century by Chenla. Sampheak Borak, the former Royal Capital
        during the Chenla Era, is located in Sambo District.[citation needed] In addition, Kratié has Vihear
        Sasar Muayroy Pagoda built in the 16th century. This pagoda is related to a Khmer legend Krapeur Nen
        Thun (Venerable Monk Thun, the Crocodile). Kratié has several temples built in the 8th century such as
        Khvas Pi, Pram, and Koh Kring that has perfect deities, ancient halls, Khmer ancient houses, and
        French-style buildings. The area near Kratié along the Mekong River was one of the most densely
        populated regions of the pre-Angkorian era of Cambodia.[2]

        Lon Nol was the province's governor in 1945.[3] During the Vietnam and Cambodian Civil Wars and the
        subsequent Vietnamese presence against Khmer Rouge in Cambodia, intense fighting took place in
        Kratié.[4] Operation Menu, the 1969-1970 United States bombing campaign targeting Vietnamese supply
        routes and bases in Cambodia and Laos, resulted in heavy bombardment of Kratié.[4][5] Recovering
        unexploded ordnance and de-mining has been a major initiative since at least the mid-2000s.[4]</p>
