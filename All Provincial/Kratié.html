      <p>Pailin (Khmer: ប៉ៃលិន, Pailĭn [ˈpajlɨn]) is a province in western Cambodia at the northern edge of the Cardamom
        Mountains near the border of Thailand. This province is surrounded by Battambang province, and was officially
        carved out of Battambang to become a separate administrative division after the surrender of the Ieng Sary
        faction of the Khmer Rouge in 1996. Pailin is known to much of the world for having long been a stronghold of
        the Khmer Rouge, remaining under their control long after they were defeated in 1979 and serving from 1994 to
        1998 as the capital of the Provisional Government of National Union and National Salvation of Cambodia. Within
        Cambodia, Pailin is known for its natural resources, namely precious gems and timber.</p>
