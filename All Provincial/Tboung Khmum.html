      <p>Tboung Khmum[3] (Khmer: ត្បូងឃ្មុំ [tɓoːŋ kʰmum], lit. 'The Gem Pearl of Bee'), also spelled as Tbong
        Khmum, is a province of Cambodia located on the central lowlands of the Mekong River. It borders the
        provinces of Kampong Cham to the west, Kratié to the north, Prey Veng to the south and shares an
        international border with Vietnam to the east. Its capital and largest city is Suong. The province's
        name consists of two words in Khmer, tboung (gem, precious jewel) and khmum (bee), which together mean
        "amber or gem".

        Tboung Khmum Province was formed when Kampong Cham Province was split in two by a royal decree signed on
        31 December 2013 by King Norodom Sihamoni on the recommendation of Prime Minister Hun Sen. The request
        by Hun Sen's government to split the province, which was ostensibly for the purpose of improving
        administrative efficiency in the large province, was made after his ruling Cambodian People's Party
        (CPP) lost the province to the opposition in the July 2013 elections.[4] The CPP won only eight of the
        available 18 National Assembly seats in Hun Sen's home province. The 10 districts that remain in Kampong
        Cham overwhelmingly voted for the opposition Cambodia National Rescue Party, led by Sam Rainsy, while
        five of the six districts cut out from Kampong Cham to form the Tboung Khmum Province were won solidly
        by the CPP.[5] The province has the highest percentage of Muslims in the country, at 11.8%.[2]</p>
